# Note to self (that's you, Amitai) - I am writing all this text in 'Perd-speak', because it resembles the mannerisms of the Parks and Recreation character: the Perd.

I should look up and read up on "markdown language"
But when? Now! ::pause::

I've looked up what Markdown is, and I think it is a fascinating story. Indeed.
Make sure that git is getting this...I've made sure.

Ahhh, now I understand.
